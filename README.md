## üöÄ Quick start

This starter theme for Gatsby uses React-bootstrap and includes very basic shell content and setup with some useful preinstalled plugins/dependencies, and core starter components.

### Components

Theme comes with an scss folder with a few starter files for layout, text, utility, and image styles, prefilled gatsby-browser.js to import scss files into main.scss, an images folder for gatsby-image queries, as well as Layout and Menu components, and a single index.js page.

### Dependencies

Gatsby, gatsby-source-filesystem, gatsby-image, node-sass. 


### Start developing

    Navigate to your new site‚Äôs directory (i.e. Gatsby Bootstrap Boilerplate) and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd Gatsby-Bootstrap-Boilerplate/
    gatsby develop
    ```

### What's inside?

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

2.  **`/src/scss`**: This directory will contain all sass files. Add more as you wish and `@import` them into main.scss. Bootstrap base styles have been imported, and I've included some basic layout, image, text, and utility (height, width) files for getting started.

3.  **`/src/images`**: This directory is for all image files. Check out gatsby-image docs for more info on optimizing and querying. Keep in mind these will be used with gatsby-image and GraphQL queries. For standard image use, background images, or quick templating, put images in the `static` folder.

4.  **`/src/components`**: Contains all component files.

5.  **`/src/pages`**: Contains all your individual site pages. These will automatically be rendered into routes that you can navigate to.

6.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

7.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is open source, free to use and alter as you wish under the MIT license.
